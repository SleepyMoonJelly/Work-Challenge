# Work-Challenge
Tic-Tac-Toe Work Challenge.

I choose to write this challenge in JavaScript, specifically using Google App Script, linked to a GoogleSpreadsheet.
Here is the link for the spreadsheet, it is public so you should be able to access it.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlozFm9t0rnpMN6sWOBpPOYEjx2_gSvXQIBLf22AZo/edit?usp=sharing
The first time you run the code you will need to authenticate the script to run in your browser
I will include the javascript code in another readme file, but it should already be integrated into the project so there is no need for you to download anything.
You may make a copy of the project under Files -> make a copy. Do this if you want to experiment. The Javascript code will be automatically coppied using this method.
